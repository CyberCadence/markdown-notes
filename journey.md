 # Lets start
 ## introduction
 C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

## variables & data types
Boolean(yes/no)
int(interger)
char (character)
float (decimal numbers with limited precison)
double(decimal with no limit) are common types of ddata types 

 ## c strings -
 mostly used in c programs.

 ## c++ strings - 
 helps to carry out some functions which are predefined in it such as to find value. s1.find(), s1.at(),etc but it has some limitations 
 eg; program for encryption & decryption of messeges 


 ## c++ functions
 c++ consist of predefined functions & we can create a create function as per our need.
