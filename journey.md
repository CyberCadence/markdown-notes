 # Lets start
 ## introduction
 C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

## variables & data types
variables are containers for storing data values.
eg int name

Boolean(yes/no) -1 & 0
int(interger) 
char (character)
float (decimal numbers with limited precison)
double(decimal with no limit) are common types of ddata types 

 ## c strings -
 mostly used in c programs.

 ## c++ strings - 
 helps to carry out some functions which are predefined in it such as to find value. s1.find(), s1.at(),etc but it has some limitations 
 eg; program for encryption & decryption of messeges 


 ## c++ functions
 c++ consist of predefined functions & we can create a create function as per our need.




 ## conditions
 if
 else
 else if
 switch
 common conditional statements




## Loops
in c++ loops are used to repeat some actions under certain conditions meet
for loop,while loop,do while loop are common types of loops

## comments
comments are not compiled 0r build,its completely for develupers for further reference about line of programs.

## pointers
pointers are address locations of the variables.eg int num. (here value of the variable is stored in a particular location & pointers are used to output the address of varibles.* is used to display the address.
